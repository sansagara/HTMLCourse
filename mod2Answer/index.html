  <h1>Our Menu</h1>

      <div class="section chicken">
        <span>Chicken</span>
        <p>At Leonel's, we're all about chicken, so you can be sure that we're extremely demanding about the chicken we serve. All of our chicken sandwiches are made with whole breast meat - not ground up pieces preformed into a patty. Each piece of chicken is hand-breaded in the Restaurant where it is served to you - fresh, hot and delicious.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
      <div class="section beef">
        <span>Beef</span>
        <p>Our 100% Pure Beef Guarantee means that all of our beef is raised without any added hormones or steroids and comes from ranchers who are committed to being leaders in sustainable production. We use only 100% beef for our patties and add absolutely nothing else. No additives. No preservatives. Just beef.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
      <div class="section sushi">
        <span>Sushi</span>
        <p>We have several sashimi dishes (without rice), and many nigiri dishes with rice. The nigiri cuts are for nigiri, not for sashimi. Serving those nigiri cuts without the rice does not make them a dish, and again, we are dedicated to serving dishes as Nozawa intends for them to be served.</p>
